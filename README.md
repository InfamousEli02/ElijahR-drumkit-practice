# ElijahR_drumkit

This practice recreates the drumkit created in the **WesBro course** video by following along with the video's steps to create the script in the HTML, to test our understanding
of Javascript basics. The outcome would allow the user to play a virtual drumkit using their computer's keyboard, and a visual indicator would appear as a key and note
is pressed.

This was accomplished using: 
- the files included (sounds, background image, index HTML, and the CSS stylesheet) in the starter
- git commands
- and by coding in JavaScript
